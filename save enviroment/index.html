                    Amazon-dwellers lived sustainably for 5,000 years</h2>

                <p id="news1p">A study that dug into the history of the Amazon Rainforest has found that indigenous people lived there for millennia with "causing no detectable species losses or disturbances".<br><br>

                    Scientists working in Peru searched layers of soil for microscopic fossil evidence of human impact.<br><br>

                    They found that forests were not "cleared, farmed, or otherwise significantly altered in prehistory".<br><br>

                    The research is published in the journal PNAS.</p><br>

                <h2 id="news2">Scientists say new dinosaur species is largest found in Australia</h2>
                <img id="newspic2" src="STE%20pic%202-%209.6.2.jpg">
                <p id="news2p">Scientists in Australia have classified a new species of dinosaur, discovered in 2007, as the largest ever found on the continent.<br><br>

                    The Australotitan cooperensis or "the southern titan", is among the 15 largest dinosaurs found worldwide.<br><br>

                    Experts said the titanosaur would have been up to 6.5m (21ft) tall and 30m long, or "as long as a basketball court".<br><br>

                    Its skeleton was first discovered on a farm in south-west Queensland.<br><br>

                    Palaeontologists had worked over the past decade to identify the dinosaur - distinguishing it from other known species by comparing scans of its bones to those of other sauropods.<br><br>

                    Sauropods were plant-eating dinosaurs known for their size. They had small heads, very long necks, long tails and thick, pillar-like legs.<br><br>
                    These dinosaurs roamed the continent during the Cretaceous Period, about 92-96 million years ago.</p><br><br><br><br>

                <h1 id="hth1">How To Help</h1>
                <h2 class="hth">1. Recycle </h2>
                <p class="hthp">Many products you purchase have an impact on the environment in some way. Recycling plastics and other materials helps reduce waste and harmful emissions from landfills and decreases your carbon footprint. It also reduces the need to use natural resources to create new products. </p>
                <h2 class="hth">2. Compost </h2>
                <p class="hthp">If you are able to, compost appropriate foods and products. This is a process that decomposes organic matter like leaves, vegetable scraps or tea bags into soil conditioner that helps plants grow. It naturally enriches soil and prevents plant pests and diseases.</p>
                <h2 class="hth">3. Buy sustainable food products</h2>
                <p class="hthp">Food production is a major driver in deforestation and loss of wildlife. Agricultural production for meat and dairy not only causes deforestation, but also uses large amounts of energy. Try navigating away from a meat-dominated diet, and buy locally or organically sourced foods. These options are often more sustainably produced and consume less fossil fuels required in transportation. </p>
                <h2 class="hth">4. Support Eco-Friendly Companies </h2>
                <p class="hthp">As a consumer, you have the purchasing power to support environmentally friendly companies that sustainably source their products. Many of these companies use a portion of their proceeds towards environmental action, including supporting Rainforest Trust, this ensures the money you spend has positive impact.

                </p>
                <h2 class="hth">5. Stay informed </h2>
                <p class="hthp">As we sit at home, many of us are drawn to our various screens throughout the day. We have all the information we could ever need right at our fingertips, so take time to read reputable sources and be cognizant of how the world is changing around us. Knowledge is power; one of the greatest ways to have an impact is to be aware. </p>
